# Contributing to Tempo

First of all — thank you for your interest in Tempo.
The fact that people want to contribute is genuinely appreciated.

Tempo started as (and currently remains) a personal project built to solve a very specific problem I personally faced. While the repository is **source-available**, contributions are handled with care to preserve the product’s direction, consistency, and long-term vision.

Please read this document carefully before contributing.

## Project Philosophy

Tempo is:
- **User-first**
- **Privacy-first**
- **Local-first**
- **Opinionated by design**

This means:
- Not every feature request will be accepted
- Not every pull request will be merged
- Stability and clarity matter more than feature volume

Tempo is not a generic “community playground” app. It is an evolving product with a clear identity.

## Contribution Model

### ✔ Allowed Contribution Flow

All contributions must follow this workflow:
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create changes in your fork**
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** with:
    - Clear explanation of what you changed
    - Clear explanation of why the change is useful
    - Screenshots or examples (if UI-related)

I will review the PR and decide whether to:
- Accept it as-is
- Request changes
- Decline it

> ⚠️ **Opening a PR does not guarantee it will be merged.**

### ❌ What is NOT accepted by default

- Large architectural rewrites
- Core behavior changes without discussion
- Major UI redesigns
- Feature additions that alter Tempo’s core philosophy
- “Experimental” changes without a clear user benefit

**If you’re unsure — open an issue or start a discussion first.**

## UI / UX Contributions (Important)

Tempo already has a defined visual language and interaction model.

UI/UX contributions are:
- **Optional**
- **Incremental**
- **Carefully reviewed**

### Allowed:
- Small usability improvements
- Spacing, alignment, or hierarchy refinements
- Accessibility improvements
- Minor consistency fixes

### Not allowed without prior discussion:
- Full UI redesigns
- Visual overhauls
- Changing the app’s visual identity
- Replacing existing UI patterns wholesale

> Design work done only in Figma may or may not be implemented. **Code remains the source of truth.**

## Feature Contributions

**Before building a new feature:**
1. Check existing issues—it might already be planned
2. Open an issue to discuss the idea
3. Describe the **problem** you're solving, not just the solution
4. Wait for feedback before investing significant time

Some feature requests may be deferred, scoped differently, or declined based on:
- Alignment with project philosophy
- Maintenance complexity
- Impact on app size or performance
- User experience consistency

## Decision Making

Tempo is maintained by a single owner with a clear vision for the product. This ensures:
- **Consistency**: Clear direction and cohesive experience
- **Quality**: Thoughtful review of all changes
- **Sustainability**: Manageable scope and maintenance

**This doesn't mean contributions are unwelcome**—it means they're reviewed carefully to ensure they benefit users and align with the project's goals.

If a PR is declined, it's about fit with the project direction, not a judgment of your abilities. Feedback will be provided to help you understand the decision.

## Attribution & Credit

- Contributors whose PRs are merged will be credited in commit history
- Large or significant contributions may be acknowledged in documentation
- Tempo remains authored and maintained by its original creator

## Code Quality Expectations

- Follow existing code style
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Write readable, maintainable code

## A Note on Intent

If your goal is:
- Learning
- Improving a source-available project
- Thoughtful collaboration

**You are welcome here.**

If your goal is:
- “Quick wins”
- Rebranding the app
- Taking over direction
- Pushing unrelated ideas

**This project may not be the right fit.**

## Contributor License

Your contributions remain attributed to you in the git history and may be acknowledged in documentation for significant work.

## Getting Help

- **Questions?** Open a discussion or issue
- **Stuck?** Ask for help—collaboration is encouraged
- **Found a bug?** Report it with steps to reproduce
- **Idea for improvement?** Share it in an issue first

## Thank You

Every contribution makes Tempo better—whether it's a one-line typo fix or a major feature. Your time and effort are valued.

Tempo is **source-available** to protect it from commercial exploitation while keeping it open for learning, auditing, and collaboration. This approach ensures the app stays free, privacy-focused, and user-first.

Thank you for being part of this project. 🎵
