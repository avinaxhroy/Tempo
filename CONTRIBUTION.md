# Contributing to Tempo

First of all — thank you for your interest in Tempo.
The fact that people want to contribute is genuinely appreciated.

Tempo started as (and currently remains) a personal project built to solve a very specific problem I personally faced. While the repository is open source, contributions are handled with care to preserve the product’s direction, consistency, and long-term vision.

Please read this document carefully before contributing.

## Project Philosophy

Tempo is:
- **User-first**
- **Privacy-first**
- **Local-first**
- **Opinionated by design**

This means:
- Not every feature request will be accepted
- Not every pull request will be merged
- Stability and clarity matter more than feature volume

Tempo is not a generic “community playground” app. It is an evolving product with a clear identity.

## Contribution Model

### ✔ Allowed Contribution Flow

All contributions must follow this workflow:
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create changes in your fork**
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** with:
    - Clear explanation of what you changed
    - Clear explanation of why the change is useful
    - Screenshots or examples (if UI-related)

I will review the PR and decide whether to:
- Accept it as-is
- Request changes
- Decline it

> ⚠️ **Opening a PR does not guarantee it will be merged.**

### ❌ What is NOT accepted by default

- Large architectural rewrites
- Core behavior changes without discussion
- Major UI redesigns
- Feature additions that alter Tempo’s core philosophy
- “Experimental” changes without a clear user benefit

**If you’re unsure — open an issue or start a discussion first.**

## UI / UX Contributions (Important)

Tempo already has a defined visual language and interaction model.

UI/UX contributions are:
- **Optional**
- **Incremental**
- **Carefully reviewed**

### Allowed:
- Small usability improvements
- Spacing, alignment, or hierarchy refinements
- Accessibility improvements
- Minor consistency fixes

### Not allowed without prior discussion:
- Full UI redesigns
- Visual overhauls
- Changing the app’s visual identity
- Replacing existing UI patterns wholesale

> Design work done only in Figma may or may not be implemented. **Code remains the source of truth.**

## Feature Contributions

Before working on a new feature:
1. Check if an issue already exists
2. If not, open an issue first
3. Explain the problem you’re solving, not just the feature

Some features may be intentionally deferred, scoped differently, or declined.

## Decision Authority

Tempo is currently a single-owner project.

- Final decisions on features, UI, architecture, and roadmap rest with the maintainer
- Declined PRs are not a judgment of skill — only of fit
- The project vision will not be diluted for the sake of faster growth

## Attribution & Credit

- Contributors whose PRs are merged will be credited in commit history
- Large or significant contributions may be acknowledged in documentation
- Tempo remains authored and maintained by its original creator

## Code Quality Expectations

- Follow existing code style
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Write readable, maintainable code

## A Note on Intent

If your goal is:
- Learning
- Improving an open-source project
- Thoughtful collaboration

**You are welcome here.**

If your goal is:
- “Quick wins”
- Rebranding the app
- Taking over direction
- Pushing unrelated ideas

**This project may not be the right fit.**

## License

By contributing to Tempo, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Final Words

Tempo is open source by choice, not by obligation.

If you respect the project, its users, and its philosophy — contributions are welcome.

Thank you for understanding.
